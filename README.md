## FIGURES
Graph | Summary
------------- | -------------
![alt text](https://github.com/PeterShin23/dsp1/blob/main/FIGURES/top20_all.png?raw=true) | Many of the top 20 words have an subjectively positive connotation, including “great”, “good”, “bought”, “like”, “love” and “well”. There seems to be little to no words with a subjectively negative connotation. While there are a majority of positive connotation words, we cannot conclude that these words necessarily are used in a context that yields or prompt a higher rating review
